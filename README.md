Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. The Git username is not the same as your GitHub username.

Setting your Git username for every repository on your computer
Open Git Bash.

Set a Git username:

git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly:

$ git config --global user.name
> Mona Lisa
